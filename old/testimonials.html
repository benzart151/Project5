This place is soo yummy and healthy. You can choose from a wrap, bowel or salad and you can choose chicken or steak. Pretty much you can choose whatever you like and make it as healthy as you want. They also have smoothies that are amazing! I absolutely love this place for a quick healthy lunch.

Everyone is very nice inside and they greet you as soon as you step in. Overall this place is very good and I almost forgot the most important thing. Make sure to always order all three sauces on whatever you're going to order.  They are absolutely amazing! You can also order them on the side so you can have extra!

Every time I walk by Benny's Pizz (I live nearby) I feel that it pulls me in and god speaks to me that I need a beer and some really awesome Itallian food. Benny's Pizza was in construction forever, but it clearly was for the right reasons. The place is tastefully decorated and has ambiance. Service is very good and it has a brick oven. Which means... excellent Pizzas! While my friends ate Pizza, I went for Pasta and it was EXCELLENT!!!. The prices are not the cheapest, however it's what you would expect of a place like this.

<p>This is as good as italian gets. Unless of course, you go to Italia!</p>
